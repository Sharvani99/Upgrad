# Upgrad
Task given by UpGrad On JAVA Tech

here we uses Priority queue based on that student with high CGPA will have more priority and if have same CGPA then based on their alphabetical order of name.

In this task we perform two events - ENTER / SERVED..

In this user will give the input that which event he want to perfrom
   if he gives ENTER as input then
       we ask for student name and CGPA and add that Student to priority Queue.
   if he gives SERVED as input then
      we remove the highest priority student from that waiting queue.

finally after performing the above events we have to display the names of students who are not yet served.
